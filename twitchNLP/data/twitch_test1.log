Look if Humanity tries to impose their own beliefs and morality upon another species besides what lay in our presently abysmal domain of earth we can expect to be destroyed for the greater good.
You know I was thinking about getting this game....but now im not so sure
Universe runs on zekeLOVE
Being an 80's kid I JUST missed out on the original trilogy, and there wasn't much at all until the mid-90's when they finally brought the whole set out on tape
Julia, what if all of human life is just a video game for some hyper advanced race of aliens, and right now, some alien nerd is bragging how he's making me as a character play pokemon and watch MAN?
your angel buddies should help you instead of doing nothing!
Faust2391 what if we are in a petree dish on someones lab table ? like a thing of seamonkies

They have convinced humans to give a warm home, feed them for free, lounge around and do nothing all day, and get pet whenever they want you to by climbing on your lap
@Gestasbsod, Time for the Milky Way Tea Party
I think Cats are smarter in there since of surviving, but dogs are smarter in communication.. I love both but i do think dogs are smarter overall
evening MAN manFIST
Faust2391 ahahah
I think love created us
Humans bastardize love, not create it :X
We did not create love.
Nor did we create art
No! art and love created us!
or Math
we discovered these things.
well, love is a chemical process, so we didn't really create it... it rather creates us because it leads to sex
Getting done work and having Man casting = the good life
Never forget Mathematics was discovered.
we kinda created art
what if god was just one of us
and everyone knows Martin is the most powerful being in the universe
You don't need sex to have children.
OH NO!
Art has always existed
Where were you, when they built that ladder to heaven
The universe is the greatest piece of Art we know of the human mind is the second its just a case of we don't know anything else.

@Wildeevee Hi bb <3
Hi sweetiepie <3
Julia_cs the effects it has on the human Autonomic system are quite profound even scary insome ways.
we had alot more to influence in domesticated dogs..but cats have been bred by humans along time too.. Its hard to determine intelligence..
that planet music is electromagnetic
It's preferable to wake up drunk and deal with the hangover later, post coffee and food, I think -__-
Is anyone in the Aerospace division here ?
Fine, just ignore me renayWut

When dealing with Infinity the possible can become impossible and the impossible can become possible.

Anyone want to clean my apartment for me. Plz.
Roflmao
there is an artist called bull of heaven that made a 10,000 year long piece of music
Why does it stop at 1000? why not do endless then...
this is the song that never ends
@Manvsgame sounds like a good gig though.
I will thunder, if you clean my entire house Kappa
what is man talking about?
MAN, they do it simply because no one else has.
that wassssss a waste of my time
I prefer my songs to be between 3 and 7 minutes
Anybody know what its called?
It's gona be like "finally this shit ends!"
ahahahha

my asshole doesn't have spikes shandSad
I thought we concluded it was smurfettes pussy

i'll be on the Snowpiercer Knives112 jamming out to it, dunno about you

I went to Juilliard -- actually C# and Db are "the same" in terms of sound and tempered piano but they "mean" different things in a key signature
