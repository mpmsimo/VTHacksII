Look if Humanity tries to impose their own beliefs and morality upon another species besides what lay in our presently abysmal domain of earth we can expect to be destroyed for the greater good.
You know I was thinking about getting this game....but now im not so sure
Universe runs on zekeLOVE
Being an 80's kid I JUST missed out on the original trilogy, and there wasn't much at all until the mid-90's when they finally brought the whole set out on tape
Julia, what if all of human life is just a video game for some hyper advanced race of aliens, and right now, some alien nerd is bragging how he's making me as a character play pokemon and watch MAN?
your angel buddies should help you instead of doing nothing!
Faust2391 what if we are in a petree dish on someones lab table ? like a thing of seamonkies
this boss is so effing random too...theres no pattern
so is this game tagged 'Impossible' on Steam? Kappa
man's face is like "wtf is chat even going on about"
SimCity 4000
Faust stop smoking jackJULIA
so.. sims playing sims controlled by aliens? please...
What if we are the aliens
we are a bad game
PogChamp are we getting into Matrix theory discussion ?

They have convinced humans to give a warm home, feed them for free, lounge around and do nothing all day, and get pet whenever they want you to by climbing on your lap
@Gestasbsod, Time for the Milky Way Tea Party
I think Cats are smarter in there since of surviving, but dogs are smarter in communication.. I love both but i do think dogs are smarter overall
evening MAN manFIST
Faust2391 ahahah
I think love created us
Humans bastardize love, not create it :X
We did not create love.
Nor did we create art
No! art and love created us!
or Math
we discovered these things.
well, love is a chemical process, so we didn't really create it... it rather creates us because it leads to sex
Getting done work and having Man casting = the good life
Never forget Mathematics was discovered.
we kinda created art
what if god was just one of us
and everyone knows Martin is the most powerful being in the universe
You don't need sex to have children.
OH NO!
Art has always existed
Where were you, when they built that ladder to heaven
The universe is the greatest piece of Art we know of the human mind is the second its just a case of we don't know anything else.
Hello MAN & MANkind! manFIST I'm still drunk from last night! renayWave

hi Reneeeeee
renayHeart
awesome Lolrenaynay
Julia_cs this music is on the 432 hz scale.
@Wildeevee Hi bb <3
Hi sweetiepie <3
Julia_cs the effects it has on the human Autonomic system are quite profound even scary insome ways.
we had alot more to influence in domesticated dogs..but cats have been bred by humans along time too.. Its hard to determine intelligence..
that planet music is electromagnetic
It's preferable to wake up drunk and deal with the hangover later, post coffee and food, I think -__-
Is anyone in the Aerospace division here ?
Fine, just ignore me renayWut
I want to make a Fluxliner..
renayStare
with that sexy Alcubierre drive..
@Mentalvary I was trying to type your name
id that the noise?
Im totally about that arrowspace stuff....
@Mentalvary I fucked ut uo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3fqE01YYWs that sound
Just type mentalhairy. According to MAN that's valid too
my brain feel like there is shit my head floating around
mentalparry
Renee ignored me too Mental
how long has MAN been stuck in this boss?
come cry here jackJULIA
after waking up from a hang over
alot of animals show signs of love humankind did not make it
@Julia_cs Julia you know I love you god damn it
She just loves me the most guys, its okay. renayFace
@Julia_cs there is a video out there with the sound of every planet it was really cool yet really freak
eeeeeee
freaky
Have you heard about that song that goes on for 1000 years or so?
theres also one of the background vibration
It's because of the butt touches, isn't it, eevee? cirPls
we need to relax with some Low G Man action manMINI
Universe is at 432hz
Try to look on the bright side Man.. I also own that shirt. Kappa
Maybe. cirWink
someone could say this planet makes a noise and put it on youtube cus we will never know otherwisem they could put themselves singing on it
Renee hates us
still my most favorite cast :P
When dealing with Infinity the possible can become impossible and the impossible can become possible.
uselessjack you mean longplay?
ChauvinistDeluxe, yeah
goes on a 1 years
I woke up to the sounds of MAN yelling so I take it progress has been not happening?
Anyone want to clean my apartment for me. Plz.
Roflmao
there is an artist called bull of heaven that made a 10,000 year long piece of music
Why does it stop at 1000? why not do endless then...
this is the song that never ends
@Manvsgame sounds like a good gig though.
I will thunder, if you clean my entire house Kappa
what is man talking about?
MAN, they do it simply because no one else has.
that wassssss a waste of my time
I prefer my songs to be between 3 and 7 minutes
Anybody know what its called?
It's gona be like "finally this shit ends!"
ahahahha
it was not me
I believe they also have a million year long song
that is pretty fucking stupid lol
just play the entire fucking song
thats pointless lol
this year is a good year C sharp
is it scientology?
people with no life
Make it 1001 years Kappa
SOMEONE has problems with their mortality
A gog
fuck the world
A gig's a gig
Note of the year is brown!
You can listen to Longplay on the Internet lol, when I listened to it it was some guy banging on a gong for 5 hours
MAN is eternal u take that back
get it on!
it was d flat!
lmfao
on top of that, the human race isn't likely to be around another 1000 years
E flat !!!!
I wanna hear a 1000 year version of Acapella Rockapella
so its a colossal waste of time
d flat is c sharp :p
ya its stupid, its nothing someone can enguy, I guess the did it just to say that their song is internally long
JUST WING IT nobody will notice
my asshole doesn't have spikes shandSad
I thought we concluded it was smurfettes pussy
prove it
i'll be on the Snowpiercer Knives112 jamming out to it, dunno about you
thats one cruel ahole
I went to Juilliard -- actually C# and Db are "the same" in terms of sound and tempered piano but they "mean" different things in a key signature
me julia? I will be dead
giant with asshole with a dick tip
Now think about the poor people who show up to hear it on a year where the composer wrote a rest.
plus you dont want to be on the snow piercer
music is good though? Kappa
that entire train is just one big form of control
Solgryn's anal intruder
don't kill me MAN
hahahaha :D And today's note is: *nothing* That's all folks, go home :D
Symphony of Science makes me feel so connected to the universe. I guess that's what it feels like to be high
frames are holding up
shitty fucking internet
jack u could just u know ,, get high
just find a scandinavian to marry MAN :P
Oh I just remembered, did you have any of that Death Wish Coffee
junglist_Soldier, not really. no access to drugs
just move in with solgryn Kappa
unless you count booze
2015 bro order em online :p
MAN I have a gift for you. Kappa
MAN will just keel over and die at the end of this game
Is this final boss?
Sh
manDARK We have this emote for a reason. You can do it MAN!
shhhh
junglist_Soldier, I'm pretty sure that's not *entirely* safe
that just suck having an isp that could provide high speed connection but can offer it in the state of MANTANA
Ah sorry
porbs not jack
but what is
is okay. the game has to end at some point... right... RIGHT?! shandSad
Doesn't matter what boss it is because MAN will be playing this FOREVER.
junglist_Soldier, me going to pay hard if I get caught ;P
military?
slow as fuck internet
server
What if at the end of the game, you get sucked into a black hole and end up in the beginning of the game and you have to play it all over again
its the 1000 year game
The problem is net neutrality issue. Comcast wants people to pay for their pipes, etc.
MAN I did Man and Martin art. Kappa
shitty hops. shitty series of tubes.
junglist_Soldier, no, germany
why is it worse in germany?
it's rather strict
meh dont matter , take a holiday and get hammered :0
But I'm planning a trip to Amsterdam with my GF anyway so...
I feel like MAN shall not rest until this boss is beaten
Poor MAN
man this bosses attacks are so fuckin random I cant figure it out >_>
I am curious about the coffee Chaotica got for you, MAN.
oh.. okay
Luckily Bloodborne overrides this madness!
Solgryn sighting :o
the music pretty good
manGRY
i think there is difficult and then there is obnoxious
^is
jackJULIA
Solgryn is going to get an earful of salt
solgryn have u completed this game u made?:p
You've heard it all before from MAN, Solgryn ;D
great to hear
Are you being mean to Solgryn?
cirPrise
ouch
when did RAM get expensive again...DDR4 man...
why don't you just stop playing it then
you said you quit games you hate or are boring
failure is not an option
He have to beat it so he doesn't ever have to play it again.
you would like to win wouldnt you solgryn!!
Solgryn keeps the souls of those who cannot complete this game under his bed
We're losin' 'im
its just a lull , it will die and we will all bask on the glory
I feel like we should be at Solgryn's front door with pitchforks and torchs for MAN's sake
Good Good.. Let the hate flow through you
Woop
Man that vagina monster is giving you the what for
Solgryn left :(
He'll live
Huh.. he did
?
MAN hurt his feelings BibleThump
no its fine
If it makes you feel better we all love you! manHURR
Solgryn is a ninja confirmed? Your'e not in viewer list
He's right there?
Lol
He's back! \ FrankerZ /
He didn't leave.
hes right there :P
Solgryn does not simply leave.
No need to make it into a big thing here guise
He is omnipresent.
Shhh Eebs, he left Kappa
Obviously he did .... n't.
Obviously.
solgryn is a gentlemen, he would say good bye if he left :D
Nah, but seriously, his name isn't showing in Mods anymore lol, so we got confused I think
Solgryn is the internet
Wasn't*
The trouble with camping the viewer list I suppose.
eogWelp
This music is gonna stick more than "There is nowhere to hide"
Keepo
Never believe in the Twitch API
His sword is gone?
cant wait to see man play a game again he actually enjoys
Hah, perhaps he left for a moment and is living the lie OMGScoots
Alright, let's change topic, talking about Solgryn is boring SoonerLater
no , he is the MAn slayer
Enjoy yourself man...don't let your emotions control your day BrainSlug

STOP STARING INTO MY SOUL

to awkward. Had to unsub Keepo
I think he snapped
Hey im back, how is progress looking so far?
i feel i need to change my priorities in life after that stare
I hope I have the patience for Boshy and Vi when I play them.. FailFish
you need a break man :P
MAN needs more Estus
Rest at bonfire?
Careful Meepmeep, the salt is strong right now
warp to coffee
It would seem like we are back to throwing deaths on the boss until something sticks ?
Stop telling him to take breaks and shit. He's a big boy.
Yeah, telling him anything he needs to do is a dangerous slope lol
Wazzaaaap manPUMP
manPUMP 'eyo

We dont care about some dropped frames mate

He cares.
Mcdonalds has more deaths Kappa
<3 eevee
why the kappa? ;D
its true
lol
Framing Frames
yeah that sounds about right
:D
lol i love how the bosses always rub it in when u die
hello
I probably have more failed attempts to get the 0.0 time in the Chocobo race in FF10 manGRY
that fucking minigame
omg. @Angberg stop lol
dont bring that horror up...
im the friend that everyone calls to do it for them....i dont like thinking about
Biffmcskylark no offense but sounds like you need some better friends
Im so sorry to hear that
like Mankind <3
don't let people use you.
I just re-played FFX and did the chocobo time in under an hour... where are my e-cookies for this?
I hate you
Well i gotta close the stream to fall asleep :) been watching u for like 8 hrs was hoping i'd see you down the boss, Goodnight!
i usually am paid in foods for doing it :)
Night, Downie
i thought the kimahri butterfly runs were harder
Biffmcskylark oh well thats ok then your friends sound pretty groovy in that respect
bye @Downieface
payment by food is always acceptable
Chocobo 0.0 is way easier than the stupid butterflies!
delicious foods
I have never ever bothered with Kimahri
right!
the other day it was literally "Dave come do this and I'll buy you burgers!"
Inb4 MAN beats boss after downie leaves
Biffmcskylark my response would have been Fyeah!
Ok, there, I'm with dota for today. When even danes call me bad :( But I love you
@Travanoid at least it has a pattern...the chocobo balloon thing is always random
The only thing that makes the race hard is the worthless controls
and the messed up hitbox ofc
@Manvsgame dont be sorry :)
MAN always makes me laugh even on those days i didnt think it would be possible. wish i could do the same for him. ill just do the next best thing and keep watching
I feel like teh butterflies have worse hitboxes than the balloons, but maybe i just have weird experiences
@Gestasbsod it was pretty much
You got this Man! Focus Focus Focus!!
@Travanoid i literally looked up a pattern box for it online and did it virtuallly without looking
This boss has alot of bullshit moves xD
Wow nice, Biff
@Travanoid i was so mad that it was so easy...
take a big deep breath MAN and let RAGE come forth
I sat there frustrated for two hours before hand
Great music though.
Does he take more damage if hes in the circle?
Chocobo race is just luck tho :/
I haven't seen MAN turn of the face cam since the grind fest in Kingdom Hearts.
Please don't ask questions that lead to spoilers/tips
you should put that sentence on a hotkey mental manMINI
I'm gonna head out, Good luck MAN!
my bad
FYI, those were not in-game sound effects
I'll put YOU on a hotkey, Kugel zekeRAGE
WutFace
Hello MAN and MANkind! manFIST
is this the last cupcake which I'm going to eat today?
turn off game music and play that if it helps :)
@Kugelkatze It already is, just scroll down manMINI
Just came back. Why can't I see Man's face? I really need some human element right now
Please
<3
MAN sounds reminded me... taco bell partnered with CinnaBon ... much win
always love me some Maynard
Compassion is broken now, my will is eroded now, desire is broken now, and it makes me feeeeel ugly
lol really @Navilus1 ???
yes. so much yes
wonder what will come out of that on the menu lol
I have one last sip left in my cappuccino and I'm too afraid to finish it OpieOP
prolly something godlike
mini cinnabons
that was bull...you totally avoided laser
they are there
Taco bell and cinnabon? my arteries are like LA freeways just thinking about it
theyve been partnered for a long ass time
lol
Hasn't Taco Bell had those Cinnabon balls for like a year now?
yeah at least a year
@Army_24_ranger they were good for a one time try
no face cam hype
not my thang
Kiffert WHY you cant see MAN's face? Of all the questions.. because he removed his face for awhile
well excuse my lack of Taco Bell patronage
I dont eat there and I knew.
IM SORRY, REALLY
good night Mankind, hope to see you tomorrow again Kappa
looking up to see the enemy, and i have swalloed the poison you're feeding me, but i survive on the poison youre feeding me
yeah afaik there were 52 days of cinnabons at taco bell
@Dovethaboveth I work in a plaza with a TB...its unfortunate for my buns
cedinsanity Too bad. I really like his face :(
probably been said a million times already but I've just joined - this boss music is fucking awesome
first it was the "cinnabon delights" little balls filled with frosting. now its "cinnabon delight coffee"
I wonder if blue angel's thighs get sore from keeping her legs crossed for so long.
ew...
louis ck's bit on cinnabon was hilarious
MAN you have nerves of steel
Blue angel is also the only one of the three that doesn't appear to be breathing.
Nerves of steel? You should have seen him fight Darklurker or FumeKnight !
Believe in MAN :)
they could be doing some damage and help MAN out :/
Ffrrrrrrtt
fart noise hype u
i hate how it just accepts that you're gonna be taking damage so it has to give you heals, its like solgryn saying "sorry, not all attacks were avoidable this time Kappa"

Can we get a fart cloud emote?

I accidentally chained Martin
